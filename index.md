**Welcome to my portfolio!** 

In this portfolio I will be showcasing some of the work I've done over the quadmester.

## Code Refactors:  
As a part of this course, we were required to add a small refactor to things our classmates have coded. Here are two projects that were originally created by Dan Shiffman.

### Snake  
I changed two small things about this project, simply involving the colours of the objects. I made the snake a light purple ```(RGB: 225, 191, 255)``` and the food a light green ```(RGB: 185, 255, 171)```.

The original project can be found here at <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/avh_VGx69">The Coding Train</a>  

### Flappy Bird  
For this one I simply changed the colours as well, but to change it up I decided to rapidly randomize each square on the group's refactoring.

Furthermore, the group's rafactor can be found at <a href="https://github.com/MasoudKarimi04/flappy-bird-presentation-/tree/main/folder">Github</a>
