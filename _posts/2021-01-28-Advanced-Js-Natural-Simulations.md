title: "Advanced JS: Natural Simulations"
date: 2021-01-28

Natural simulations was the hardest module by far. I had a difficult time progressing through most of the challenges, and without videos the lessons were increasingly difficult for me to understand. It was likely necessary for me to give it more time and possibly further study many of the math concepts involved. I did take a good amount of things away from it, however I feel as though I still need to practice with them before I can comfortably use them anywhere. For example, I learned about forces in Processing, and how they can be used to simulate the natural movement of an object (eg. a ball). I also learned about how to generate more natural random numbers, which can be used to create more natural movement.
