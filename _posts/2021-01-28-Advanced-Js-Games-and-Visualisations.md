I found this course rather difficult. That being said, that meant it was quite a challenge for me to get through. I found myself getting stuck often and had trouble progressing through. Once I did, on the other hand, I felt like I understood why it was so challenging and was able to take that, along with everything else I learnt in the module, with me. This module taught me more JavaScript, but it in some ways also showed me that I shouldn’t just give up on things. I think that was the most important thing I took from it. I wasn’t able to accomplish anything amazing in it but I do feel I took a lot away from it. It taught me that computer science can be hard, really hard but afterwards it showed me how rewarding pushing past the hard parts can be. I think that is what this module can teach me to push me to continue computer science in the future.
