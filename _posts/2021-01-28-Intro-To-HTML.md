This module also had a great impact on me. Learning about HTML and what goes into basic web design was incredibly interesting and even the small things I was doing felt significant and each lesson felt like I was making actual progress, even if it was small. I can definitely say that this will be helpful to me in the future, as if I ever decided to go into web design - which is a real possibility - I’d most certainly need to know what was taught in this course. Before taking this, I didn’t have much interest in web development, however, when I realized (through this course) how fun it could be, my interest for it greatly increased. Putting things on the “website”, which was just a canvas, was rewarding enough that it kept me wanting to complete the course.
