Digital information taught me all about even more things Iâ€™ve always wanted to learn about. For example, the digital information course explained highly important concepts such as binary and data compression. I now know how to count binary numbers and what different types of data compression do as well as how they work. I gained a lot of skills from learning about all of that. Secondly, Algorithms further deepened my understanding of how they work and what goes into making them. It introduced different types of algorithms, such as heuristic and undecidable problems. Lastly, it introduced me to the concept of parallel computing and the benefits of using it to my advantage. In regards to computer science, knowing these concepts makes it simpler to understand and are important concepts to utilize within the realm of computer science.
