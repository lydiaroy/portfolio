This module introduces the basics of programming, although for me it did more to solidify them. Seeing these things outside of a coding environment helped me deepen my understanding of the concepts. Having them explained through text and examples like were used in the programming lessons gave me the information I needed to fully grasp the logic behind programming. Furthermore, it taught me many useful terms and concepts that are so key. It also taught me how to read and write proper standardized AP CSP pseudocode. Finally, mathematical procedures, if statements and strings were easy to understand due to these lessons. Knowing these terms and how to use each tool to the best of my ability will help me further my understanding of computer programming and computer science as a whole, which therefore encourages me to continue on with it.
