The little module we covered for GitHub was a huge help to me - in fact, I likely wouldn’t have been able to make this portfolio without it. It taught me how to navigate through the site and use many of its features to my advantage. I learned what a repository is, how to use pull requests and even how to host a site (much like this one) all through GitHub. I took a lot away from the activities and this is something that will be able to help me a lot in the future, as GitHub is such a large platform and is used by computer scientists everywhere. It also gives me an opportunity to potentially look into other open source projects and see if I have anything I can offer to the table. If not, I can still read through them and see what they accomplish. So, I’ll be able to take something away from the project whether I can help with it or not.
