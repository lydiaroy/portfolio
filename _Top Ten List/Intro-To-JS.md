title: "Intro To JS"

---
This module probably had the most impact on me as a whole. Firstly, it’s what started it all and created the base to continue in the course as it teaches the basics of JavaScript. It will help me to continue on in computer science because JavaScript is such an important part of that and is a language that is used so often. It’s so important to at least learn the basics. What made the biggest impact with this module for me was how easy it was to get started. While the language quickly got a lot trickier, the basics were rather easy to understand and pick up and it was quite interesting to learn. Animating with JavaScript wasn’t my favourite thing in the world, but I was able to recognize its meaningfulness and importance as the course progressed. It was key to know how to animate and draw with JavaScript so that the rest of the lessons made sense.
